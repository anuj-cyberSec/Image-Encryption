# Image Encryption using Python and AES

## Overview

This project is an image encryption application developed in Python using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt images, providing a secure way to protect sensitive visual data.

## Key Features

- **AES Encryption:** The project utilizes the AES encryption algorithm for securing images.
- **Image Processing:** It processes images by resizing and generating secret images.
- **Visual Encryption:** The application performs visual encryption to protect the image.
- **User-Friendly GUI:** A Graphical User Interface (GUI) provides an intuitive way to interact with the application.
- **Password Protection:** Users can set passwords for encryption and decryption.

## Getting Started

**Clone the Repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/anuj-cyberSec/Image-Encryption
   cd your-repo


**Install Dependencies:**
  pip install pillow pycrypto tkinter

**Run the Application:**
  python image_encryption_app.py


**How to Use**

    Launch the application.

    Choose an image to encrypt using the "Encrypt Image" button.

    Set a password for encryption.

    Click "Encrypt" to secure the image.

    To decrypt an image, select "Decrypt Image" and provide the password.

    Click "Decrypt" to retrieve the original image.
